# OTClient Modues
Here is a collection of otclient modules I create in my spare time.</br>
You can freely use them in any project and modify it to your liking.</br>
If you find bugs or have improvements please make sure to create either an issue or a pull request.</br>

## Recommended Hunting Places
This module serves as a guide for inexperienced or new players or just to show custom hunting places.</br>
It basically mimics the tibia wiki page by displaying recommended hunting places for your level.</br>

</br>

There are still a few functions missing such as creating a mark on the minimap, filtering by skills and showing the location on a external map.</br>



## Minimap Party Icons
This module helps you keep track of your party members by showing them on the minimap.</br>
Please check the wiki https://github.com/RekzaiSharp/otclient-mods/wiki for more information on how to install this module.
